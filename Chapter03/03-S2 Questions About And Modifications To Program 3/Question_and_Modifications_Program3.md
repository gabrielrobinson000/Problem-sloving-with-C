QUESTIONS ABOUT AND MODIFICATIONS TO PROGRAM 3

20. In Program 3, why don't we read in the pay for each employee?
	
	Because that not how the program is currently intended to be used.

21.a. Why isn't 0000 or 9999 a good trailer value for Problem 3?
	
	It's like a bad password it too common and it could be
	an employees number.

21.b. Instead of using a trailer value, why don't we just set 
 up a 'for' loop to read in 25 employees? or 15?
	
	Because the while loop program doesn't need to be modified 
	if the number of employees increases. And the for loop does
	need to be moded if the number of employees changes.

22. What happens in program 3 if the user forgets to enter -1111
 as the last ID number and instead enters 1111?
	
	It is processed by the program like a normal user ID and
	 the goes through another input cycle.
