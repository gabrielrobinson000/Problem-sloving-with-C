	To another function xor program or to the screen.

2. Does that line need a semicolon?
	No.

3. In the ouput, each pair of values print to a new line because of the '\n' character in the control string of the 'printf'.
 What would happen if we omitted the '\n' from the control string?
	It would not put the next value/string on a new line.


Self-Check 1-6

	One, maybe.

3. In example 1-5, what doescompiler consider to be the body of the 'for' loop?
